## Idriç rewrite branch

This branch is a fresh Idriç implementation. It is not a branch for extending the existing handwritten C/GLSL implementation or mechanically transliterating it.

Before writing or reviewing Idriç-facing source, read the current canonical Idriç guidance:

1. `isomorphisms/Idric` branch `Idriç`: `STYLE.md`
2. `isomorphisms/Idric` branch `Idriç`: `examples/intent/railway/README.md`
3. `isomorphisms/Idric` branch `Idriç`: `examples/intent/http_server/README.md`
4. `isomorphisms/Idric` branch `Idriç`: `AGENTS.md`

Those sources govern Idriç style. Do not infer new-source style from inherited Idris, Haskell, C, GLSL, generated code, or bootstrap code.

For new Idriç source:

- write purpose-ordered top-level code and put intent above mechanism;
- prefer ordinary and domain vocabulary, grammatical role phrases, and semantic types;
- use `snake_case` for ordinary identifiers;
- use `Number`, not `Nat`; use `List`, not generic `Vect`, unless a domain-specific shape is genuinely part of the meaning;
- use Idriç Unicode notation, including `→`, `←`, `⇒`, `≠`, `≝`, `∘`, and mathematical `−` where appropriate;
- reserve `=` for equality; do not use it as a definition marker;
- call side-effecting procedures actions rather than functions; reserve “function” for mathematical mappings;
- hide primitives, JNI/FFI declarations, raw graphics/API calls, and other machinery below meaningful source-facing actions;
- keep build, packaging, generated, test-harness, and compiler machinery under `_` where the repository uses that boundary;
- explain non-obvious numerical constants and representation choices by their meaning;
- do not invent a speculative folder/module architecture in advance. Establish modularity later from real reuse and semantic boundaries.

Do not put new handwritten Holomorphic/Wegert mathematics or rendering logic in C or GLSL on this branch. Existing C/GLSL on other branches may be consulted as an oracle for behavior, but it does not define the Idriç architecture and must not be copied alongside the new implementation. Android uses DEX/JNI as the practical host boundary until the relevant Idriç CPU backends are ready. GPU work must exercise the Idriç shader backend when that path is claimed. The x86-64 backend may be used for offline rendering only when the generated x86 path actually executes. Do not use Python in the implementation, rendering, test, or reference pipeline.

When a compiler/backend limitation blocks the clean Idriç expression, fix or expose the general compiler/backend limitation rather than adding an application-specific escape hatch.

## Cross-repository anti-patterns

These rules apply in addition to stricter repository-specific rules below.

- Claim only the boundary actually exercised. Source presence, fixtures, generation, compilation, packaging, installation, launch, smoke checks, semantic execution, backend execution, and physical-device execution are different evidence levels. If a stronger boundary was not exercised, report it as unverified.
- The named mechanism is part of acceptance. Do not substitute a fallback, oracle, mock, alternate backend, alternate executable, lookalike renderer, or conventional nearby toolchain and keep the original label.
- Do not weaken acceptance to obtain green. Repair the implementation. Change the contract only when the requirement itself is shown to be wrong or obsolete, and keep that semantic decision explicit. Targeted negative tests must fail for the intended reason when the distinction matters.
- Keep semantics independent of convenient representations. Mathematical, domain, and language objects are not defined by tuples, matrices, compiler nodes, ABI records, transport bytes, storage shapes, or UI payloads unless the semantics explicitly say so.
- Current explicit human corrections and current architecture outrank stale source, generated code, upstream conventions, older branches, bootstrap precedent, and familiar practice. Do not restore a rejected abstraction under its old name or a near-synonym.
- Acceptance belongs to an exact head and its material pins. An ancestor's, sibling branch's, or previous pin's green result is historical evidence only.
- Mocks, fixtures, harnesses, and today's platform adapter must cross replaceable interfaces; they do not get to define the permanent architecture merely because they are currently convenient.
- Preserve the repository's chosen implementation path and layout before introducing familiar infrastructure. Where `_` is an established machinery boundary, keep build/package/generated/test/compiler material there and preserve canonical source and intended soft links.

## Rendering work is runtime work

When a task asks for a screenshot, image, video, MP4, GIF, screen recording, animation, or other visual demonstration of this app or renderer, the evidence must come from the actual software under test running.

For a tagged release, install and launch the APK built from that exact tag. For development work, identify the exact commit/build being run. A successful build, unit test, shader compile, fixture render, or standalone rendering experiment is useful evidence, but it is not a substitute for running the requested app path.

Do not substitute any of the following while claiming they show app behavior:

- AI-generated images or animation frames;
- Python, ffmpeg, HTML/canvas, desktop, or other separately implemented renderers;
- a test harness that merely resembles the app;
- cross-fades between screenshots or keyframes;
- interpolation, optical-flow synthesis, pan/zoom, stabilization, or other invented motion;
- a hand-made reconstruction of the intended visualization;
- frames produced by a different executable or renderer than the one named in the task.

If the requested behavior is not present in the current app, change the app, build a new artifact, run that artifact, and capture the resulting runtime behavior. Do not manufacture missing behavior in post-production.

## Exact backend provenance

Running an APK is necessary but is not by itself proof that the requested implementation path ran.

If a task names a compiler or rendering backend, the visual evidence counts for that backend only when the executed artifact actually contains and selects code produced by that backend. This applies in particular to `idris-shader-backend`, `idric-arm-thumb`, DEX/ART, x86-64, and any GPU-specific path.

Do not claim a backend passed merely because related source files exist in the APK or repository. Prove the path that executed. In particular:

- handwritten NDK/Clang C is not evidence for an Idriç CPU backend;
- handwritten GLSL is not evidence for `idris-shader-backend`;
- a CPU fallback is not GPU-backend evidence;
- an emulator using SwiftShader is not physical PowerVR evidence;
- successful shader compilation without a live draw is not rendering evidence;
- successful installation without proving the selected runtime path is not backend acceptance.

When fallback paths exist, make the selected path observable in logs or another runtime receipt. If the requested path cannot be proved, report it as unverified rather than silently substituting another path.

Keep enough provenance to reproduce visual evidence:

- repository and commit/tag;
- APK/build artifact and, when practical, its SHA-256;
- compiler/backend revision used to generate executable or shader code;
- device/emulator and GPU/renderer identity;
- package/process identity while recording;
- launch procedure;
- runtime evidence of backend selection and fallback status;
- raw capture or an unambiguous path to it when practical.

## Motion continuity is an acceptance requirement

A video can come from the real app and still be wrong. Inspect the runtime motion itself.

Use one continuous running process for a continuous demonstration. Do not hide resets, unrelated runs, state reloads, or discontinuities with editing.

Animation and random deformation must evolve persistent state. Do not independently redraw object positions, identities, coefficients, camera state, or deformation parameters on each frame. Randomness may drive a continuous process, but the visible state should be integrated continuously through time.

Time-step handling must tolerate ordinary frame-time variation. A dropped or delayed frame must not produce an unintended teleport or a large unrelated state update.

If an algorithm scores candidate directions, sample points, or proposed updates and then applies a different blended or larger increment, the applied motion must itself be validated or continuously interpolated. Sparse candidate scoring does not certify an arbitrary intervening step.

Before calling a moving render acceptable, inspect enough consecutive frames to catch:

- teleporting or sudden jumps;
- periodic resets or rerandomization;
- marker identities swapping accidentally;
- camera/viewport jumps not requested by the user;
- animation that freezes while only overlays move;
- background evolution that stops while poles/zeros continue moving;
- discontinuities introduced only when recording starts or loops.

If the runtime is jumpy, fix the runtime. Do not smooth, interpolate, cross-fade, or conceal the jump in the delivered video.

## Preserve the established visual language

Do not change the color pipeline merely to make motion more obvious.

Unless the task explicitly asks for a color-design change, preserve the established domain-coloring behavior, including hue, saturation, brightness/value, gamma, contrast, and any canonical Wegert color mapping or fixtures. Do not turn up saturation, exposure, contrast, or brightness as an incidental rendering change.

A mathematical change to the displayed function may naturally change the colors. But for the same function, viewport, settings, and time/state, a backend change should reproduce the same intended image within the numerical precision expected of that backend.

For renderer/backend work, keep at least one stable reference state or fixture and compare it before and after the change. Treat unexplained global hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, orientation, or viewport drift as a regression until explained.

## Mathematical identity during motion

When the visualization contains poles and zeros/holes, movement is not a type change. A pole remains a pole and a zero/hole remains a zero/hole unless the mathematical model is explicitly being changed.

Poles and zeros may wander long distances, cross paths, and exchange regions while retaining their identities. Their visible trajectories should be continuous when wandering is requested; do not accomplish an exchange by deleting and respawning differently typed markers.

When the model deliberately multiplies a rational zero/pole factor by a holomorphic nonzero factor, that deformation must not silently create, remove, or retype the preserved zeros and poles in the visible domain.

If the user asks for the field, soup, or background to evolve while poles/zeros wander, both must evolve together in the running app. Do not freeze one layer and synthesize motion in the other afterward.

## Presentation video means the visualization, not device chrome

A runtime video intended as an animation, visual example, artwork, or mathematical demonstration should normally contain the visualization itself, not the surrounding Android interface.

Unless the task explicitly asks to demonstrate interaction or device UI, exclude from the delivered animation:

- the Android status bar, clock, battery, network and notification icons;
- Android navigation buttons or gesture/navigation chrome;
- emulator/device frames or black borders that are not part of the rendered viewport;
- app placement controls, tool buttons, menus, debug overlays, touch indicators, or other controls that the viewer cannot use in the finished video;
- transient UI shown only to set up the state before recording.

Prefer a real runtime presentation/capture mode that hides system bars and app controls while leaving the actual renderer running. If the app does not have such a mode and the requested deliverable is a clean animation, add one or otherwise capture only the app's content surface. A crop that removes only non-content device chrome is acceptable when it does not rescale, distort, recompose, or fabricate the visualization, but runtime hiding is preferable.

Keep a separate uncropped/raw runtime capture when needed for provenance or debugging. Do not confuse that evidence recording with the user-facing animation. The final presentation artifact should be clean unless the user explicitly asks to see controls or the full device screen.

## Capture and delivery

Capture screenshots and moving evidence from the running process. For Android, verify that the installed package remains live during capture and retain logs or equivalent receipts sufficient to establish the executing path.

Post-processing is limited to operations that do not invent or alter demonstrated behavior, such as trimming, container conversion, audio removal, ordinary encoding/resizing, or removing non-content device chrome as described above. Do not use transitions, frame synthesis, color grading, stabilization, or interpolation to repair the evidence.

Before presenting a visual artifact as evidence of app behavior, verify all of the following:

1. the exact requested build was installed/launched;
2. the app process was actually running while the frames were captured;
3. the requested backend path, if any, was actually selected;
4. the capture is from a continuous runtime segment rather than a reconstruction;
5. the motion is visually continuous where continuity is intended;
6. established rendering/color behavior has not changed unintentionally;
7. mathematical object identities and requested simultaneous background motion are preserved;
8. the user-facing animation excludes unrequested system chrome and noninteractive controls.

If any of these cannot be established, say exactly what remains unverified. Do not convert missing runtime evidence into a pass by using a mockup, alternate renderer, alternate backend, or post-production.

## Preserve the source-facing layout

Build systems, packaging, generated files, test harnesses, compiler machinery, receipts, and other build-time support belong under `_` rather than being scattered through the source-facing tree.

Keep maintained source canonical in its source location and expose intended source-facing top-level entries through soft links when the repository uses that pattern. Do not replace a soft link with a duplicate generated copy or let two writable copies of the same source diverge.

Before adding a build instruction or generated artifact outside `_`, verify that it is genuinely part of the maintained source surface rather than build machinery. A familiar Android/Gradle directory layout is not, by itself, a reason to override this repository's layout.
